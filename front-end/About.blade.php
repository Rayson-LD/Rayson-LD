<h1 style="margin-top:10%;"><u>ADVANTAGES :</u></h1>
<h4><b>Increased productivity:</b></h4>
<p>
Another soft cost saving is greater fleet operations productivity. With outsourced maintenance, you no longer have to recruit your man power like Fleet Manager, Engineer, Supervisor,and technician etc...
</p>
<h4><b>More proactive approach:</b></h4>
<p>
With this greater efficiency, you also have the chance to address the pesky maintenance task backlog that built up when maintenance was in-house. Your fleet can become more proactive and prevent small tasks from developing into issues now that you have access to more resources. In turn, you will prevent repair and replacement costs from continuing to rise.
</p>
<h4><b>Less Risky:</b></h4>
<p>
Customers owners/management can be away from the worries of Vehicle/Equipment repair and maintenance and they can concentrate more on their business developments
